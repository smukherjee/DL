promise we will read every email and we'll try to address commonly occurring issues although depending on the email volume I can't guarantee that we'll be able to reply promptly to every email but we will read every email than you send next I know that there are other companies that wish to train maybe large numbers of employees with deep learning if you're responsible for employee training in your company and would like to train a hundred or more employees with deep learning expertise please feel free to get in touch at this email and we'll see if we can help you        <br/>

we're just in the early phases of developing the university academic program but if you're a university instructor or a university administrator interested in offering a deep learning course at your university please feel free to contact us as this email address though        <br/>
