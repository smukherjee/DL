00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,705
In the earlier videos from this week as well

2
00:00:02,705 --> 00:00:05,735
as from the videos from the past several weeks,

3
00:00:05,735 --> 00:00:08,075
you've already seen the basic building blocks

4
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:10,456
of forward propagation and back propagation,

5
00:00:10,456 --> 00:00:14,090
the key components you need to implement a deep neural network.

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,303
Let's see how you can put these components together to build a deep net.

7
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:20,333
Here's a network with a few layers.

8
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:27,290
Let's pick one layer and look at the computations focusing on just that layer for now.

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:33,410
For layer L, you have some parameters WL and BL,

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,645
and for the forward prop,

11
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:42,180
you will input deactivations AL-1,

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,895
from the previous layer, and output AL.

13
00:00:48,895 --> 00:01:00,105
The way we did this previously was you compute ZL=WLxAL-1+BL,

14
00:01:00,105 --> 00:01:08,025
and then AL=G_of_ZL, right?

15
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:12,990
That's how you go from the input AL-1 to the output AL.

16
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,330
And it turns out that for later use,

17
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,640
it'll be useful to also cache the value ZL.

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,060
Let me include this cache as well because

19
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,170
storing the value ZL will be useful for backwards,

20
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,290
for the back propagation step later and then,

21
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,745
for the backward step,

22
00:01:32,745 --> 00:01:34,785
for the back propagation step, again,

23
00:01:34,785 --> 00:01:37,390
focusing on computation for this layer L,

24
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,635
you're going to implement the function that inputs

25
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:51,840
the AFL and outputs DAL-1.

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,650
Just to flesh out the details,

27
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,050
the input is actually DA of L,

28
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,130
as well as the cache,

29
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,040
so you have available to you the value of ZL that you computed,

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,755
and then in addition to opening DAL-1,

31
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:09,940
you can either output the gradients you

32
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,025
want in order to impliment gradient descent for learning.

33
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:19,772
So this is the basic structure of how you implement this forward step,

34
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,680
what we call the forward function as well as this backward step,

35
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,970
we should have called it backward function.

36
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,535
Just to summarize, in layer L,

37
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:32,650
you're going to have the forward step or the forward prop or the forward function,

38
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:38,986
inputs AL-1 and output AL,

39
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:42,070
and in order to make this computation,

40
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,650
you need to use WL and BL, and also,

41
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:54,185
I'll put a cache which contains zero and then, the backward function,

42
00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:56,357
using the back prop step,

43
00:02:56,357 --> 00:03:01,650
will be another function that now inputs

44
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:08,065
DA_of_L and outputs DAL-1.

45
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:13,820
That tells you, given the derivatives respect to these activations,

46
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,950
that's DA_of_L, what are the derivatives?

47
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,400
How much do I wish AL-1 changes?

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,590
So compute the derivatives with respect to the activations from the previous layer.

49
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,870
Within this box, you need to use WL and BL,

50
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,200
and it turns out along the way,

51
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,144
you end up computing DZL,

52
00:03:34,144 --> 00:03:36,400
and then just box.

53
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,515
This backward function can also output DWL and DBL,

54
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:47,740
but I now sometimes using red arrows to denote that the backward animation,

55
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,668
so if you prefer, we could fill these arrows in red.

56
00:03:51,668 --> 00:03:55,305
If you can implement these two functions,

57
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:59,390
then the basic computation of the neural network will be as follows.

58
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,453
You are going to take the input features A0,

59
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:07,710
feed that in, and that will compute the activations are the first layer,

60
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,624
let's call that A1.

61
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:14,535
To do that, you needed W1 and B1

62
00:04:14,535 --> 00:04:21,090
and then we'll also cache away Z1.

63
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,475
Now, having done that,

64
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:25,290
you feed that to the second layer,

65
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,026
and then using W2 and B2,

66
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:32,355
you're going to compute the activations of the next layer A2,

67
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:36,475
and so on, until eventually,

68
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:40,065
you end up outputting A_capsule_L,

69
00:04:40,065 --> 00:04:42,655
which is equal to Y_hat.

70
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:51,595
And along the way, we cached all of these values Z,

71
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:55,161
so that's the forward propagation step.

72
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,585
Now for the back propagation step,

73
00:04:57,585 --> 00:05:03,220
what we're going to do will be a backward sequence of

74
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:12,200
iterations in which we are going backwards and computing gradients like so.

75
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,350
It's going to feed in here, DA_of_L,

76
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,674
and then this box would give us DA of L-1,

77
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:30,424
and so on, until we get DA2, DA1.

78
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:35,500
You could actually get one more output to compute DA0,

79
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,250
but this is derivative with respect to your input features which is not useful,

80
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:46,237
at least for training the weights of these supervised neural networks,

81
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:48,160
so you could just stop it there.

82
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,365
Along the way, back prop also ends up outputting DWL, DBL.

83
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:58,800
Just use parameters WL and BL,

84
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,810
this would output DW3,

85
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,238
DB3, and so on.

86
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:16,660
You end up computing all the derivatives you need.

87
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,235
Just to maybe fill in the structure of this a little bit more,

88
00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:28,500
these boxes will use those parameters as well, WL,

89
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,560
BL, and it turns out that we'll see later that inside these boxes,

90
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,460
we end up computing DZs as well.

91
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:43,305
One innovation of training for a neural network involves starting with A0, which is X,

92
00:06:43,305 --> 00:06:46,725
and going through forward prop as follows,

93
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:50,715
computing Y_hat and then using that to compute this,

94
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:55,680
and then back prop, doing that.

95
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,880
Now, you have all these derivative terms,

96
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:08,830
and so W will get updated as W minus the learning rate times DW for each of the layers,

97
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,570
and similarly for B.

98
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:17,757
Now, the compute the back pro and have all these derivatives.

99
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:21,845
That's one iteration of gradient descent for your neural network.

100
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:25,125
Before moving on, just one more informational detail.

101
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:29,665
Conceptually, it'd be useful to think of the cache here as storing

102
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:34,361
the value of Z for the backward functions,

103
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:35,635
but when you implement this,

104
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:38,496
and you see this in the former exercise, we implement this,

105
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:40,840
you find that the cache may be a convenient way to

106
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,730
get this value of the parameters of W1,

107
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,648
B1 into the backward function as well.

108
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:47,868
In the former exercise,

109
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,795
you actually store in your cache, Z,

110
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:52,239
as well as W and B,

111
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:57,715
so just store Z2, W2, B2.

112
00:07:57,715 --> 00:07:59,860
From an implementational standpoint,

113
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,120
I just find this a convenient way to just get the parameters copied

114
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,975
to way you need to use them later when you're computing back propagation.

115
00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:15,446
That's just an implementational detail that you see when you do the programming exercise.

116
00:08:15,446 --> 00:08:20,061
You've now seen one of the basic building blocks or influencing a deep neural network.

117
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:21,640
In each layer, there's a forward propagation step

118
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,260
and there's a corresponding backward propagation step,

119
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,675
and there's a cache to parse information from one to the other.

120
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:28,930
Im nächsten Video,

121
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,250
we'll talk about how you can actually implement these building blocks.

122
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,500
Let's go into the next.
